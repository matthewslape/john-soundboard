# john-soundboard

My father-in-law, John, had a severe stroke on 12/31/2021, resulting in him having to spend days at the E.R, followed by weeks at a stroke rehabilitation center. Since this happened in the heat of a covid case spike, there was a point where the hospital decided that they would no longer let visitors in to spend time with the patients. This was devastating for our family, and we knew it would be incredibly tough for John to have to be in his room alone. On top of all of this, he had a tough time communicating with his nurses. I was trying to think of ways to help, and came up with this web app, accessible to John on his iPad.

This app, John’s soundboard, is set up with two grids. The top grid is loaded with buttons that have John’s family members' names on them. When the buttons are pressed, an audio recording to John from the family member pressed is played. The bottom grid is set up with common needs that John has had trouble communicating, and when clicked turn green, take up the whole screen, and play an audio of the need he is trying to communicate. The buttons are purposely big and bold, so that John can see and click them easily.

This was built using Simple html, css, and vanilla JS. It was good practice for connecting audio to buttons. It's nothing fancy, but it solved a problem near to my heart, and really helped a family member in need.
